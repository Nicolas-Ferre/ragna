Ragna is a library for easily creating GPU-native applications, where most of the logic is run
directly on GPU side.

It is particularly well suited for graphics applications such as games.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

Before you consider using this library, please keep in mind that:

- It is developed by a single person in his spare time.
- The library is highly experimental, so it shouldn't be used for production applications.

## Main characteristics

- üî• Maximize execution on GPU side
- üí™ Strong typing and compile-time checks performed with Rust
- üîÄ Data race free
- üîÑ Hot reloadable GPU code

## Supported platforms

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS (limited support because the maintainer doesn't have access to a physical device)
- Android
- Web

Ragna may also work on some other platforms, but they have not been tested.

## Getting started

You can use the following command to run examples located in the `examples` folder:
